# Installation
* Download [Python](https://python.org/) (if you installing Python on Windows, check the "Add Python to PATH" mark on the first installing step)
* Download all files from this repository (README&#46;md not required, you can delete it)
* Place your bot token to config&#46;yml
* Install the packages from requirements.txt ("pip3 install -r requirements.txt" in Windows CMD or Linux Terminal)
* Run main&#46;py ("python main&#46;py" in Windows CMD or Linux Terminal.)

P.S. - Add a bot to the server when the bot is enabled, so it will add your server to prefixes.json and write a prefix for it. If you add a bot to the server turned off, after turning it on, it will not respond to commands.
